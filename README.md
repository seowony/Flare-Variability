# Flare Variability Detection Algorithm

## Overview
A comprehensive statistical approach for identifying and analyzing M dwarf flares using multi-color (uvgriz) photometric data from the SkyMapper Southern Survey. This algorithm leverages near-simultaneous broad-band observations to detect and validate flare events with high statistical confidence.

## Usage

```python
# Usage examples to be added
