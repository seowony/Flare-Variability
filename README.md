# Flare Variability Detection Algorithm

## Overview
A comprehensive statistical approach for identifying and analyzing stellar flares using multi-color photometric data from the SkyMapper Southern Survey. This algorithm leverages near-simultaneous broad-band observations to detect and validate flare events with high statistical confidence.
